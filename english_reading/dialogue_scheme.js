/*

My idea is to have a set of appliable sentences to the dialogue to return

The smart way is to make something find it or something

Its not AI if it just links to something

So it needs to try to interpert meanings before it can start replying


should also process some word and TRY to detect sarcasm with bad words and using other
words to mean something else for example (go fuck yourself), (shit out a joke)

basically it can find a verb or something and see if it doesnt have another verb or item
next to it and check if that word is something in a dictionary
