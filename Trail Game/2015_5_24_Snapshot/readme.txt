Hello Tim!

You can replace images and stuff, but don't try to edit the
script since its fairly complex and can't really do much with
the variables since it will just break. If you want to edit
something just tell me and ill tell you want to edit, or ill
edit it and send it to you.

========CHEAT CODES

uuddlrlrba (Change) => open debug console (see below how to use)

rosebud => add 1,000 bucks to your pocket

timBBQQT => Turn on glitch mode

========HOW TO USE THE DEBUG CONSOLE
This will probably be removed before you using it but this
will stay here to remind me to remove it and maybe show you
how to do things with it.

Its gone so yeah.... not really, i didnt bother telling you the
commands and the variables you need to use for the commands.
