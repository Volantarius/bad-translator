Hello Tim!

DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING IN THE GAME!

You can replace images and stuff, but don't try to edit the
script since its fairly complex and can't really do much with
the variables since it will just break. Deleting stuff will
just make the game not work and thats not fun.

CHEAT CODES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Goto the credits window and press backspace in the window to
open up the cheat code enter menu. Then type in the name and
hit enter! (make this look like the sims cheat thing!)

uuddlrlrba (Change) => open debug console (see below how to use)

rosebud => add 1,000 bucks to your pocket

fergus => add 100 drinks to the inventory (?)

asd

HOW TO USE THE DEBUG CONSOLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This will probably be removed before you using it but this
will stay here to remind me to remove it and maybe show you
how to do things with it.

You enter commands and hit enter. There done. Here's a
reference to the commands and things you can input!

showbuyinv -inventory name- => Show the buy/purchase inventory
		of a inputed list of items! or you can use the list
		"everythin" to give you a list of all the items in the
		game.

showplayerinv => This just shows you the window of your wagon
		inventory. Nothing special.

appenditem -item name- -amount- => This will give you the item
		you input along with the amount. This will actually
		remove the item amount if you input a negative number.
		Cool huh? this command is used for buying stuff and
		selling.

changecanvas -scene name- -dialogue name- => This will change
		the little window where you click things take you to
		a specified scene. This is basically the command that
		all the clickable things in the window uses to take
		you to other places.

HERE ARE SOME INVENTORIES AND ITEM NAMES TO INPUT

Inventories:
listTest => first list of items added to the game!

listTestTwo => blah

everythin => every single item is in here and not for free.

Items:
objectClock => the grandfather clock!

objectRedhat => testitem wont break anything
