These are the features and functions to be removed/disabled for release.

This is here mostly to remind me of the debugging tools that need to be removed before any release
to MonotoneTim, or anyone else.

Position - Name : How to

519 - canvasDebug : Remove by: removing the variable and then in the canvas functions:
					changeCanvas and addElement. Inside these functions remove the if statement
					if (canvasDebug == 1). This will remove the ability to turn on the debug.

7 - Debug Console : Remove the comment for the remove command.
					This will remove the debug console upon trying to show the console.

521 - setInterval : Remove this one line to remove the debug overlay from running.

1449 - Debug Overlay : Remove the comment and allow this command to remove the overlay completely.
					This will remove the overlay when ran and only sharp eyes can find it.
