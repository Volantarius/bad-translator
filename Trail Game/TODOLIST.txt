Finally made one of these to keep track of what i need to finish!
( - ): Feature to add
( > ): Bug
(///): Do it now

- Rest system to rest for players, and stuff

- IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	Remove the wagon leader from sick things. The leader will only get sick and die if all the
	other members have DIED.

- Food and player refreshers and changers
	Simulate the food change when traveling, not resting because of random events...
	Also if it is during the trail, then it will quickly check if the players are starving.
	Things like "way too much food" when tim buys way too much food for the trip.
	Use an array of strings for rendering the morale and food amount, and sick, etc.

- Finish all the random events

- Revise and finish the health indicators

- Add trading system

- River crossing animations (maybe just a gif or video?)

- Sound effects
	var snd = new Audio("sounds/thing.wav");
	snd.play();
	//note you can set the currenttime to 0 if you want to play the audio multiple times while its being played
	Heres the deal, if i want to make this a seperate thing I need to make the sound effects completely on
	my own or someone else has to make them since i dont know how to make sounds and music. Since im not
	distributing this, i could just use the original sounds but this is a seperate thing and shouldn't
	just use the original sounds. I know that mecc is gone for good I could probably use the sounds without
	being sued, but that isnt the point of using the original sounds.

	The music can be started when the progression scene is loaded like the showPS function, and whenever a
	new scene is loaded the volume will either go quiet or stop the music and count upwards the time
	when the scene is there, and continue playing the music after the scene is closed and the progression
	scene is then shown again. Additionally when a scene is loaded with its own music the same is done
	and whenever a scene is loaded with its own music will just replace playing the old music.

- Character dialouge
	Its probably a good idea to have character dialogue menus, to make the game more interesting.
	I think i could just add a new window like the notification window and have dialogue buttons
	inside of there, along with the character's face (probably wont talk) along with the sound
	effects to play the spoken dialogue.

- Progression Icons
	Icons/Images for the wagon and locations. The wagon hopfully will be from murugo's orweedgon trail
	video. Also should try and add a real oxen amount indicator for the wagon, so if you have 3 oxen
	the icon will show you having 3 oxen. Also when you rest icons, maybe even morale level indicators.

- Background Improvements
	Additionally to the progression icons for the ox and destination. The background can be very
	detailed. My idea is that the foreground for the background can be above the actual canvas
	background. The background will have a sky and the sky can be cloudy, rainy, etc. Reflecting
	the real weather state. The foreground will have the earth's background to overlap the sky.
	Then the other elements like the wagon and destination will overlay the foreground and sky.

- Longer day travels ???
	The game right now will only play random events at the end of a day of travel, the real game will
	display them anytime during a day. During which the wagon gets stopped and displays the event.
	Sadly I can't pause the wagon at all, so maybe split the days into events that get calculated to
	play. Thinking about it, ive actually already wanted to do this before and forgot. Oh well.

- Saved Game ???
	If javascript allows this, should add the simple ability to save your game. This should be very
	easy to do. Simply save the current state of all the global variables, and add a variable of
	what the current canvas scene the player is on. Also should save the console log! Once on load
	the game will inherit the variables and goto the last state the player was on. This should infact
	work.

- Saved Stats and Graves
	If javascript allows this, the game must have a leaderboard like in the original and also save
	the gravestones that the player makes!

===================================================================================================

- Sickness should include grandfather clock count for chances!

- Chat Box for changing colors/etc.
	Add a button to add a challenge instead of just no challenge sitting there

	Maybe add the own game's challenges that will notify or literally prevent the player from
	doing the things that the challenge requires. Maybe also add a exception if in a soft lock.
	Maybe add a notification to ask the player if they want the game to be handled differently,
	or not.

	Maybe add a handler that will check to see if Tim did or did not meet the challenge goal.
	If tim hasn't set the game modifier, the game will notify Tim that he broke the rules and
	has not finished the challenge. If the challenge is a end game challenge or a during the
	game challenge, then they will notify Tim that hes meet the goal!

	Maybe even also add something to keep track of all the times tim has broken the challenge
	rules, meet the challenge goal, and the date (maybe?), somewhere so the chat can see it or
	etc.
	
- JOHN CENA
	Maybe like tiny elvis you get a dialogue box and it leads to the dialogue reading to like the
	john cena phone call thing, and then it pops up with JOHHHHN CEEENA DUN DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNN

- Code Blue
	When someone is about to die, you perform a operation to save them like in code blue.

- Dust!
	Add the town of dust into the game!! why not!
	Maybe tim can buy a sheriff's badge to visit dust.
	Additionally, he could show hes badge like in ace attorney.

- Hunting gamemodes instead of just the normal boring hunting
	Since the canvas system is really reliable at displaying graphics effortlessly
	I could make a set of scenes where the player will play something like DOOM,
	where you can shoot enemies and gain a score for food.

	A pokemon hunting gamemode would be stupid easy to simulate. Its kinda offensively easy.
	So you fight a few pokemon to get food and stuff!

- Puyo Puyo
	Ok puyo puyo sounds like a cool fun idea but idk how well it would fit in, and also this
	one is alot more complex than the DOOM/Pokemon hunting gamemodes. Also tim might not like
	the half-assed nature of it.

- Tiny Elvis Cameo?
	Im thinking of like just a character you can talk too in a town at the end of the game.
	Maybe a giant elvis? with a 2001 intro as GIANT ELVIS.
	
	GIANT ELVIS: maybe it would be funnier if instead a tiny elvis its GIANT ELVIS and sutff.

- 42 Oxen
	Maybe if tim buys 42 or 14 oxen thatll be an easter egg for me Volante42.

- Time Travel
	When the wagon gets stuck in the mud, you can open the credits menu to time travel.
	Maybe also you can buy a flux capaciter
	Or even when you have 88 oxen
	You get a cutscene of the progression scene where your wagon looks like a delorean,
	and you speed up to time travel.
	Maybe add time sickness? like parkingsons?

- Cheats
	Real Ideas for cheats:
		- rosebud: Get moneys!
		- tim time: brings up the time circuit controls, to then time travel.
		- diE: revive all players.
		- pleh: get a list of all the cheats in the game, and maybe some debug console commands?
		- mount c everything: opens debug console.
			//This is a joke because tim cant dosbox.
		
	Now that ive made a map script, maybe i can add a map of the entire game where you can go to
	places in the game?? And also use the map to show progress as well, and the cheat will allow
	the option to travel there.
	maybe = (apply snow on frostbite)
	
	Dumb Ideas for cheats:(or ones that are for novelty and not really a cheat)
		- timBBQQT: Glitch out the game!
		- Kappa:
		- smoke weed everyday:
		- volante: a secret thing of me? maybe a super secret cheating menu?
		- JOHN CENA: brings up the john cena thing
		- giant elvis: brings up the giant elvis thing
		- pandas:
		- this is the police:
		- hello wildcats:
		- webber:
		- bee: Flips the game upside down
		
		- pet sounds: maybe change the background to a pet sounds styled tshirt thing.
	
	Maybe include a fake firefox popup on the bottom that will say goofy things during the game or
	even game crash notes.
	With the john cena thing, it could pop up with john cena stuff with a john cena background and
	play the music silently and stuff as just a annoyance.
